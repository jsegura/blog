Hello from Hugo! I decided to start blogging again and I hope this is not one of the countless times I tried.

I chose [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/) because I think a blog don't need anymore than static content and Hugo is *super* fast. It's written in [Go](http://golang.org/), it compiles pages in ms, it has Markdown support, it's easy to install and I can deploy it to Github pages. It deserved a try!
Comment capability is provided by Disqus and I'm only using Twitter bootstrap.

I will talk about development, system administration, devops, ...

Let's see what happen!
